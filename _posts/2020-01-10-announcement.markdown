I'm very excited to announce that the [Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) will be
funding [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) and [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) to develop interactive image processing tools
for Python, with a specific focus on life science applications.

We will develop modular tools for interactive image processing, based on
- the [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) Python library, which is a collection
  of image processing algorithms, focussing mostly on scientific imaging
- the [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) web app framework, which allows to write analytical interactive
  web apps in pure Python or R. Dash includes interactive graphs based on the
  [plotly graphing library](https://plotly.com/python/) which will be used for image visualization.

The project has several work packages

- maintenance, community support and documentation
- acceleration of interactive image processing, with parallelization and
  caching 
- development of interactive annotation tools, for example for semi-supervized
  image segmentation or for building a training set of instances for machine
learning models.

We are very honoured to be part of an [amazing list of open source projects](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/)
selected in the EOSS program. Updates about specific developments and demos
will be posted here. If you are curious about the tools, we suggest that you take
a look at the documentations of the two packages:
- [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)
- [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) documentation

Support is available on the forums of the different projects
- [community forum of scikit-image](https://forum.image.sc/tag/scikit-image)
- [community forum of plotly and Dash](https://community.plotly.com/)
